# R code to generate suitability map of human *P. knowlesi* malaria infections

The code directory contains the R code used to run analyses for the manuscript *Estimating geographical variation in risk of zoonotic Plasmodium knowlesi infection in countries eliminating malaria* accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.

The main script is 'master_script.R' which names the R packages required and calls the other scripts in order. The package 'seegSDM' can be downloaded from the 'seeg-Oxford' github repository of the same name. This repository is not fully reproducible but enables readers to scrutinise the methods in detail.
